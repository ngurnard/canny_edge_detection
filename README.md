# canny_edge_detection

This project was done for a computer vision and computational photography
course during my masters degree at the University of Pennsylvania. The 
results and details of how this project was completed can be found
in the PDF "cannyEdge_ngurnard.pdf". 

The main code for the project is the file "cannyEdge.py". This
project was originally written in Google Colab, which utilizes
Jupyter notebooks, and thus much of the code was
written as if it were a .ipynb file. Therefore, ignore many of the
comments that refer to Google Colab at the top of the file. If there are any questions please feel free to reach out!
